"""The bell-shaped Gaussian function, is one of the most widely
used functions in science and technol-ogy. The parameters m and s are real numbers, where s must be
greater than zero. Make a program for evaluating this function when
m = 0, s = 2, and x = 1. Verify the programâ€™s result by compar-
ing with hand calculations on a calculator."""
